# Vercel Import Troubleshooting

## üö® Repository Not Showing in Vercel Import List

If you don't see `dumitrudabija/aia-assessment-server` in the repository list, here are the solutions:

## üîß Common Solutions

### 1. GitHub Connection Issues

**Check GitHub Integration:**
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to Settings ‚Üí Git
2. Verify GitHub is connected and authorized
3. If not connected, click "Connect GitHub Account"
4. Authorize Vercel to access your repositories

### 2. Repository Permissions

**Grant Repository Access:**
1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí Authorized OAuth Apps
2. Find "Vercel" in the list
3. Click on it and check permissions
4. Ensure it has access to your repositories
5. If using GitHub Organizations, grant organization access

### 3. Repository Visibility

**Check Repository Settings:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/dumitrudabija/aia-assessment-server
2. Ensure the repository is **Public** (not Private)
3. If Private, either make it Public or upgrade Vercel plan

### 4. Refresh Repository List

**Force Refresh:**
1. In Vercel import page, look for a "Refresh" button
2. Or try logging out and back into Vercel
3. Clear browser cache and try again

## üîÑ Alternative Import Methods

### Method 1: Direct Repository URL

Instead of browsing the list, try importing directly:
1. In Vercel, click "Import Git Repository"
2. Paste this URL: `https://github.com/dumitrudabija/aia-assessment-server`
3. Click "Continue"

### Method 2: CLI Deployment

Use the command line instead:
```bash
cd /Users/dumitru.dabija/Documents/Cline/MCP/aia-assessment-server
npx vercel --prod
```

Follow the prompts:
- Link to existing project? **N**
- What's your project's name? **aia-assessment-server**
- In which directory is your code located? **./**

### Method 3: Fork and Import

If the repository still doesn't show:
1. Fork the repository to your personal GitHub account
2. Import the forked version from Vercel

## üîç Debug Steps

### Step 1: Verify GitHub Connection
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your profile ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Git
3. Should show "Connected" next to GitHub

### Step 2: Check Repository Access
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/applications
2. Find "Vercel" in Authorized OAuth Apps
3. Click "Revoke" then reconnect with full permissions

### Step 3: Verify Repository Exists
Visit: https://github.com/dumitrudabija/aia-assessment-server
- Should be accessible and public
- Should show recent commits

## üéØ Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] GitHub account connected to Vercel
- [ ] Repository is public (not private)
- [ ] Vercel has permission to access repositories
- [ ] Browser cache cleared
- [ ] Tried refreshing the repository list
- [ ] Attempted direct URL import
- [ ] Considered CLI deployment as backup

## üöÄ Expected Vercel Configuration

Once imported, Vercel should detect:
- **Framework**: Other
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `build`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

## üì± After Successful Deployment

You'll get a URL like:
```
https://aia-assessment-server-abc123.vercel.app
```

Test it immediately:
```
GET https://your-url.vercel.app/health
POST https://your-url.vercel.app/api/analyze
```

## üÜò If All Else Fails

### Alternative Deployment Options:

1. **Railway**: https://railway.app (GitHub import)
2. **Netlify**: https://netlify.com (drag & drop build folder)
3. **Render**: https://render.com (GitHub integration)

### Local Testing with Public Access:
```bash
# Use ngrok for temporary public URL
npx ngrok http 3000
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Make repository public** for easiest Vercel import
2. **Use CLI deployment** if web interface has issues
3. **Check Vercel status page** for service issues
4. **Try different browser** if import page doesn't load properly

The most common issue is GitHub permissions - ensure Vercel has full access to your repositories!
